Key Observations:
High Purchasers Dominate Revenue (56.23%)

The High segment accounts for $5.01M, making up more than half of total sales.
This segment is crucial for business growth and should be the primary focus for retention efforts.
Medium Purchasers Contribute Significantly (26.58%)

The Medium segment contributes $2.37M, showing potential for conversion into high-value customers.
Offering personalized incentives or loyalty programs can help move them to the "High" category.

Sales from Very High purchasers are $0.72M, which is a relatively smaller share.
Understanding their needs and offering exclusive rewards might encourage further spending.
Low Purchasers Generate Minimal Revenue (5.28%)

The Low segment accounts for $0.56M, indicating that these customers may only make occasional purchases.
Strategies such as targeted marketing, discounts, or promotions could encourage more frequent transactions.
Top Buyers Segment (Negligible Contribution)

The Top Buyers category is almost non-existent, suggesting that only a few customers consistently make very high-value purchases.
Identifying and nurturing these customers with personalized experiences can drive loyalty and repeat business.
Recommendations for Growth:
📌 Retention Strategy for High Spenders – Implement VIP programs, personalized offers, and early access to sales for the High and Very High segments.
📌 Convert Medium Customers into High Purchasers – Offer targeted promotions or exclusive discounts to encourage more frequent purchases.
📌 Engage Low-Spending Customers – Improve marketing outreach, recommend personalized products, and provide incentives for first-time buyers to increase spending.

Key Observations:
Medium Purchasers Form the Largest Group (2,595 customers - 60%)

The majority of customers belong to the Medium segment.
This suggests that most buyers make moderate purchases, creating an opportunity to convert them into high-value customers.
High Purchasers (1,059 customers - 24%)

A significant number of customers belong to the High segment, but there is still room for growth.
Retaining these customers and increasing their purchase frequency should be a priority.
Low Purchasers (661 customers - 15%)

These customers make occasional purchases but have the potential to be engaged with targeted marketing efforts to increase their spend.
Very High and Top Buyers Segments are Extremely Small (17 & 3 customers respectively - <1%)

Strategies such as exclusive memberships, loyalty perks, and personalized marketing can encourage more customers to enter this segment.
